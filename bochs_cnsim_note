1.About Pram prolog
0x40000340-0x4000036C,0x400004BC IO_RSTRT_XXX cannot sync with cnsim 
2.About APIC
0xFEE00300 don't occur in cnsim result mem, it occur in tracer dump 0x40000D38, but data isnot sync with cnism program seg
0xFEE000F0 don't update in result part too.
3.About segment descripotors in protect mode/comp mode/long mode
GTD index 0 cannot be used. But cnsim still update seg descriptors, if seg selectors index filed is 0. This point result in cnsim mismatch with bochsmismatch address may be 0x40000808-0x40000834
4.About Core prolog
0x40000860-0x4000087C is like FSdesc_ext,GSdesc_ext, don't know the meaning
Intel IA-32 don't have GDTdesc/IDTdesc, so don't care mismatch 0x40000844 and 0x4000084C.
5.About tracer type2 reload
bochs don't dump EFLAGS, RDI ,RSI ,RBP ,RSP ,perf crl0/crl1 and tsc in RDMSR/CPUID/RDTSC/RDPMC. So 0x40020028,0x40020050-0x40020084 may mismatch
6.About last excption vector and interrupt vector
cannot handle now
